# Battleship

An online multiplayer version of Battleship built with ASP.NET Core MVC.

In Battleship, the player must guess the locations of enemy ships in order to sink them all and win. Each turn consists of picking a grid square to fire on. 
After each attack, the player is notified of the results- whether a ship was hit, sunk, or if the shot missed -and can use that information to deduce the position
of the enemy ships.

The project will have online multiplayer functionality including user profiles that display player statistics and match hosting between arbitrary users or a computer player.
